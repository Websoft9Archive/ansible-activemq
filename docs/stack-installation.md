## Q&A

#### I can't visit the start page of ActiveMQ?

Your TCP:8161 of Security Group Rules is not allowed so there no response from Chrome or Firefox

#### ActiveMQ service can't start? 

Make sure your **hostname** of Server not include the str ".". e.g activemq5.6 is a not regular for ActiveMQ

you can rename hostname by the following command

```
hostnamectl set-hostname activemq
```
